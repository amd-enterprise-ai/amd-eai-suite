"""Generic CRD polling framework - syncs K8s CRD state to DB.

This module provides a generic polling framework that can be configured
to poll different types of Kubernetes Custom Resources and sync their
state with the database.

The framework is configured by registering resource syncer callables that
handle the specific sync logic for each resource type.

## Syncer Design Requirements

Syncers run concurrently, each with its own isolated database session.
When writing syncers, follow these guidelines:

1. **Independence**: Syncers should operate on independent data sets.
   Do not rely on another syncer's changes within the same polling cycle.

2. **Session Isolation**: Each syncer receives its own AsyncSession.
   This session is NOT shared with other syncers running concurrently.

3. **Transaction Handling**: Each syncer's session operates in its own
   transaction. Commit or rollback decisions are independent per syncer.

4. **Resource Constraints**: Keep syncers lightweight to avoid connection
   pool exhaustion. Limit concurrent database operations within each syncer.

5. **Error Handling**: Syncers should handle their own exceptions.
   One syncer's failure does not affect other syncers in the same cycle.

6. **Idempotency**: Syncers may be called multiple times. Ensure they
   handle repeated calls safely without duplicating work or data.
