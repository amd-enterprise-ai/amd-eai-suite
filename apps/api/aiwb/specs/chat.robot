    ...    filter returns only AIMs whose serving stack is fully ready
    ...    (InferenceServiceReady and HTTPRouteReady). A running AIM should appear in the list.

    Given a ready project with user access exists
    And project quota is set to    gpu_count=2    cpu_milli_cores=8000    memory_bytes=68719476736
    And AIM is deployed and running
    When chattable AIM services are listed
    Then response status should be 200
    And the running AIM should appear in chattable list
