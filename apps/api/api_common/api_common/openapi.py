"""Helpers for exporting a service's OpenAPI specification to a file.

The exported spec is committed under ``docs/external-docs`` and rendered into
the public documentation site, so it must be **deterministic** — independent of
the environment it is generated in. ``FastAPI.openapi()`` is already stable for
a given codebase except for the OpenID Connect discovery URL, which is derived
from ``KEYCLOAK_*`` environment variables (see ``api_common.auth.config``).
We replace that single environment-derived value with a documented placeholder
so a developer with a local ``.env`` produces the same file as CI.
