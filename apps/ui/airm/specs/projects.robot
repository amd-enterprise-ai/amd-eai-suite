Documentation       Frontend E2E tests for AIRM project management.
...
...                 These tests verify the admin user experience for project lifecycle:
...                 creation, dashboard, quota configuration, member management,
...                 secrets and storages visibility, GPU preemption settings,
...                 status polling, and project deletion.
...
...                 Tests run against a live AIRM deployment and require an admin user
...                 with access to at least one healthy cluster.

*** Test Cases ***
Admin creates a new project through the UI
    [Documentation]    Verify that an admin can create a project with a name and cluster,
    ...                the project appears in the list, and the user lands on the edit page.
    [Tags]    ui    airm    projects    create    smoke

    Given an admin user is logged in to AIRM
    And a healthy cluster is connected
    When the user creates a project with a name and cluster assignment
    Then the user is taken to the project edit page
    And the project appears in the project list

Newly created project transitions to ready status
    [Documentation]    Verify that a newly created project transitions from pending to ready
    ...                without manual page refresh, via automatic status polling.
    [Tags]    ui    airm    projects    status    polling

    Given an admin user is on the projects page
    When the user creates a project with a name and cluster assignment
    Then the project status should eventually be ready

Admin creates a project with GPU preemption enabled
    [Documentation]    Verify that an admin can enable GPU preemption settings during
    ...                project creation and the settings are saved.
    [Tags]    ui    airm    projects    create    preemption

    Given an admin user is on the projects page
    When the user creates a project with preemption enabled
    Then the preemption settings should be saved with the project

Admin views quota allocation details for a project
    [Documentation]    Verify that the quota tab displays resource allocation values
    ...                and admin controls for GPU, CPU, memory, and disk.
    ...
    ...                NOTE: Setting quota values is currently blocked by a UI rendering
    ...                bug where the AllocationSettings component renders in read-only mode
    ...                (plain text spans instead of SliderInput components) even for admin
    ...                users. The Save/Discard buttons appear correctly, but the form fields
    ...                are not editable. This test verifies the quota display and admin
    ...                controls until the rendering issue is fixed.
    [Tags]    ui    airm    projects    quota

    Given an admin user is editing a project
    When the user navigates to the quota tab
    Then the quota tab shows resource allocation values
    And admin quota controls are visible

Admin adds a team member to a project
    [Documentation]    Verify that an admin can add a platform user who is not yet

    When the user navigates to the members tab
    And adds the user as a project member
    Then the user appears in the project members list

Admin views project secrets tab
