Documentation       Frontend E2E tests for AIRM role-based access control.
...
...                 These tests verify that team member users see a restricted UI view
...                 compared to platform administrators. The AIRM UI enforces RBAC
...                 by filtering sidebar navigation items, redirecting from admin-only
...                 pages, and hiding admin-only settings.
...
...                 All tests log in as a team member user to verify restrictions.
